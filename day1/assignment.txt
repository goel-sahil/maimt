Project Initialization
1. Initialize a new Node.js project.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (express, mysql2, body-parser).
3. Set Up Express Server

Create an entry file (e.g., app.js).
1. Set up a basic Express server that listens on a specific port.

3. Read: Fetch the user with address

Test Your Endpoints
1. Use tools like Postman to test your API endpoints to ensure they work as expected.

Error Handling
